## What are virtual environments?

Virtual environments allow you to create and maintain development environments
that are isolated from each other. Lambda recommends using either:

- [Python venv](#creating-a-python-virtual-environment)
- conda

### Creating a Python virtual environment

1. Create a Python virtual environment using the `venv` module by running:

```
{ .sh .copy }
python -m venv --system-site-packages NAME
```

Replace **NAME** with the name you want to give to your virtual
environment.

::: tip[My tip]
The command above creates a virtual environment that has access to
Lambda Stack packages and packages installed from Ubuntu repositories.

To create a virtual environment that doesn't have access to Lambda Stack
and Ubuntu packages, omit the `--system-site-packages option`.

2.  Activate the virtual environment by running:

```
{ .sh .copy }
source NAME/bin/activate
```

Replace **NAME** with the name you gave your virtual environment in the
previous step.

Python packages you install in your virtual environment are isolated from
the base environment and other virtual environments.

::: tip[My tip]
Locally installed packages can conflict with packages installed in virtual
environments. For this reason, it's recommended to uninstall locally installed
packages by running:

To uninstall packages installed locally for your user only, run:

```
{ .sh .copy }
pip uninstall -y $(pip -v list | grep ${HOME}/.local | awk '{printf "%s ", $1}')
```

To uninstall packages installed locally, system-wide (for all users), run:

```
{ .sh .copy }
sudo pip uninstall -y $(pip -v list | grep /usr/local | awk '{printf "%s ", $1}')
```

:::danger [Don't Uninstall on Lambda GPU Cloud On-demand Instances]
**Don't run the above uninstall commands on Lambda GPU Cloud on-demand
instances!**
    
The above uninstall commands remove all locally installed packages and, on
on-demand instances, break programs including pip and JupyterLab.
